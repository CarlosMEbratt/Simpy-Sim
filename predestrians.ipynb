    "### Pedestrian Traffic Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "This project simulates pedestrian movement through a crosswalk, incorporating a traffic light system that alternates between red and green. The simulation tracks pedestrians as they walk, wait at the crosswalk, cross the road, and finish their journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**\n",
    "* Traffic Light System: Simulates a traffic light alternating between red and green. Pedestrians wait at the crosswalk if the light is red.\n",
    "* Randomized Pedestrian Behavior: Pedestrians have random arrival times and varying walking speeds, simulating real-life behavior.\n",
    "* Real-time Visualization: An animated plot visualizes the pedestrian movements through the different stages of their journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Structure**\n",
    "* TrafficLight Class: Manages the state of the traffic light (green/red) and signals to pedestrians when they can cross.\n",
    "* Pedestrian Function: Simulates the behavior of a pedestrian, including walking, waiting at the crosswalk, crossing, and finishing.\n",
    "* Pedestrian Generator: Generates pedestrians at random intervals to simulate continuous pedestrian traffic.\n",
    "* Simulation Function: Runs the entire simulation and returns the data for visualization.\n",
    "* Visualization: The simulation results are visualized using matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation, showing the progression of each pedestrian.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customization**\n",
    "* Number of Pedestrians: Modify the NUM_PEDESTRIANS variable to simulate more or fewer pedestrians.\n",
    "* Traffic Light Timing: Adjust GREEN_LIGHT_DURATION and RED_LIGHT_DURATION to change how long the traffic light stays green or red.\n",
    "* Simulation Time: Change SIMULATION_TIME to simulate for a longer or shorter period.\n"

    "3.\tWALKING_TIME:  This defines the range (in minutes) of time it takes for a pedestrian to walk between points. The walking time is randomly selected from within this range.\n",
    "4.\tCROSSWALK_TIME:  This parameter defines the range (in minutes) of time a pedestrian has to wait at the crosswalk before they can cross. The wait time is randomly selected from within this range.\n",
    "5.\tSIMULATION_TIME:  This defines the total duration (in minutes) of the entire simulation. Once this time is reached, the simulation stops, even if all pedestrians haven't finished their journey.\n",
    "6.\tGREEN_LIGHT_DURATION:  This defines how long (in minutes) the traffic light stays green, allowing pedestrians to cross the road.\n",
    "7.\tRED_LIGHT_DURATION: This defines how long (in minutes) the traffic light stays red, preventing pedestrians from crossing the road.\n"
