    "### Pedestrian Traffic Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "This project simulates pedestrian movement through a crosswalk, incorporating a traffic light system that alternates between red and green. The simulation tracks pedestrians as they walk, wait at the crosswalk, cross the road, and finish their journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**\n",
    "* Traffic Light System: Simulates a traffic light alternating between red and green. Pedestrians wait at the crosswalk if the light is red.\n",
    "* Randomized Pedestrian Behavior: Pedestrians have random arrival times and varying walking speeds, simulating real-life behavior.\n",
    "* Real-time Visualization: An animated plot visualizes the pedestrian movements through the different stages of their journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Structure**\n",
    "* TrafficLight Class: Manages the state of the traffic light (green/red) and signals to pedestrians when they can cross.\n",
    "* Pedestrian Function: Simulates the behavior of a pedestrian, including walking, waiting at the crosswalk, crossing, and finishing.\n",
    "* Pedestrian Generator: Generates pedestrians at random intervals to simulate continuous pedestrian traffic.\n",
    "* Simulation Function: Runs the entire simulation and returns the data for visualization.\n",
    "* Visualization: The simulation results are visualized using matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation, showing the progression of each pedestrian.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customization**\n",
    "* Number of Pedestrians: Modify the NUM_PEDESTRIANS variable to simulate more or fewer pedestrians.\n",
    "* Traffic Light Timing: Adjust GREEN_LIGHT_DURATION and RED_LIGHT_DURATION to change how long the traffic light stays green or red.\n",
    "* Simulation Time: Change SIMULATION_TIME to simulate for a longer or shorter period.\n"

    "2.\tARRIVAL_INTERVAL:  This is the average time interval (in minutes) between the arrival of each pedestrian at the crosswalk. The actual time between arrivals is randomly determined using an exponential distribution with this average.\n",
    "3.\tWALKING_TIME:  This defines the range (in minutes) of time it takes for a pedestrian to walk between points. The walking time is randomly selected from within this range.\n",
    "4.\tCROSSWALK_TIME:  This parameter defines the range (in minutes) of time a pedestrian has to wait at the crosswalk before they can cross. The wait time is randomly selected from within this range.\n",
    "5.\tSIMULATION_TIME:  This defines the total duration (in minutes) of the entire simulation. Once this time is reached, the simulation stops, even if all pedestrians haven't finished their journey.\n",
    "6.\tGREEN_LIGHT_DURATION:  This defines how long (in minutes) the traffic light stays green, allowing pedestrians to cross the road.\n",
    "7.\tRED_LIGHT_DURATION: This defines how long (in minutes) the traffic light stays red, preventing pedestrians from crossing the road.\n"
